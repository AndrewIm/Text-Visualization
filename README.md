### Data Processing

### Interesting Findings

#### Correlation between news on Iraq and the US-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement

From the visualization, it is noticeable that Huffington Post news related to Iraq drops significantly from late 2008 to early 2009.  This drop occurs around the time the US-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement was signed.  It is likely that the effects of this agreement (the withdrawal of US troops in Iraq) led to less news reporting on Iraq.

#### Comparison of 2008 and 2012 presidential election seasons

It is apparent from the visualization that news coverage of the top 50 terms is at a maximum during the 2008 and 2012 election seasons.

The visualization also shows that the term frequency of elected presidential candidates is substantially higher than the frequency of the other candidate during the months following the election.
